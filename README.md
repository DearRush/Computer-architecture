# README

This is the lab assignments I completed in the course Computer Architecture. In this project, it includes SIMD instructions (Instruction Parallelism), Assembly Code, Cache and Memory.

In the experiments, I analyzed and understood the mechanism of how computer system architecture works by running the actual code and theoretical derivation of the knowledge in computer architecture.

Shown here are a few experiments that I think are very meaningful, in which I was able to visualize the working principle of computer through the result of running the code designed by myself, which is also the most important and interesting point for me.

Each folder corresponds to the corresponding experimental content, and in the PDF (or word) file in each folder is the report of my current lab assignment. Also each folder contains the relevant code for this experiment.

The picture below each folder is part of the display results. (The PDF file also contains the relevant display)
